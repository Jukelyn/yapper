> **This guide serves to set clear expectations for everyone involved with the project so that we can improve it together while also creating a welcoming space for everyone to participate. Following these guidelines will help ensure a positive experience for contributors and maintainers.**

## :inbox_tray: Opening an Issue

Before [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue), check if you are using the latest version of the project. If you are not up-to-date, see if updating fixes your issue first.

### :beetle: Bug Reports and Other Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report. :v:

In short, since you are most likely a developer, **provide a ticket that you would like to receive**.

- **Review the documentation** before opening a new issue.

- **Do not open a duplicate issue!** Search through existing issues to see if your issue has previously been reported. If your issue exists, comment with any additional information you have. You may simply note "I have this problem too", which helps prioritize the most common problems and requests. 

- **Prefer using [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)**, not comments, if you simply want to "+1" an existing issue.

- **Fully complete the provided issue template.** The bug report template requests all the information we need to quickly and efficiently address your issue. Be clear, concise, and descriptive. Provide as much information as you can, including steps to reproduce, stack traces, compiler errors, library versions, OS versions, and screenshots (if applicable).

## :love_letter: Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted. We want to avoid [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep). Your idea may be great, but also out-of-scope for the project. If accepted, we cannot make any commitments regarding the timeline for implementation and release. However, you are welcome to submit a pull request to help!

- **Do not open a duplicate feature request.** Search for existing feature requests first. If you find your feature (or one very similar) previously requested, comment on that issue.

- **Fully complete the provided issue template.** The feature request template asks for all necessary information for us to begin a productive conversation. 

- Be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it relates to existing features. Include implementation details if possible.

## :repeat: Submitting Pull Requests

*Note: All contributions will be licensed under the project's license.*

- **Smaller is better.** Submit **one** pull request per bug fix or feature. A pull request should contain isolated changes pertaining to a single bug fix or feature implementation. **Do not** refactor or reformat code that is unrelated to your change. It is better to **submit many small pull requests** rather than a single large one. Enormous pull requests will take enormous amounts of time to review, or may be rejected altogether. 

- **Prioritize understanding over cleverness.** Write code clearly and concisely. Remember that source code usually gets written once and read often. Ensure the code is clear to the reader. The purpose and logic should be obvious to a reasonably skilled developer, otherwise you should add a comment that explains it.

- **Follow existing coding style and conventions.** Keep your code consistent with the style, formatting, and conventions in the rest of the code base. When possible, these will be enforced with a linter. Consistency makes it easier to review and modify in the future.

- **Add documentation.** Document your changes with code doc comments or in existing guides.

- **[Resolve any merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github)** that occur.

- Use spaces, not tabs.

## :white_check_mark: Code Review

- **Review the code, not the author.** Look for and suggest improvements without disparaging or insulting the author. Provide actionable feedback and explain your reasoning.

- **You are not your code.** When your code is critiqued, questioned, or constructively criticized, remember that you are not your code. Do not take code review personally.

- **Always do your best.** No one writes bugs on purpose. Do your best, and learn from your mistakes.

- Kindly note any violations to the guidelines specified in this document. 

## :nail_care: Coding Style

Consistency is the most important. Following the existing style, formatting, and naming conventions of the file you are modifying and of the overall project. Failure to do so will result in a prolonged review process that has to focus on updating the superficial aspects of your code, rather than improving its functionality and performance.

When possible, style and format will be enforced with a linter.
